                    According to statics, there are more than 5.1 billion active users on the internet. For better comprehension, 6 out of 10 people in the world are online users and with the advancements in technology, that number is only bound to grow. With these numbers, in bigger parts of the world, life without technology is difficult to fathom. Even a momentary breach of the internet or the power can cause irreplaceable damage to businesses and personal life. Technology has become an integral part of life and business.  <br> <br>

Since the start of society, business activities have become a fundamental part of human activity, and technology has only expanded it and made it easier. The start of the barter system led people to trade for things they needed with things they had in abundance. This trading system slowly changed into buying and selling goods after money was invented. Then came along the capitalistic system of buying and selling from businesses which are based on profit. Integration of technology with business not only helps in business expansion but also helped in increasing profits. Technology applications of today's generation have increased the pace and output of various business activities such as marketing, sales, promotion and accounting. <br> <br>

With the invention of technologies such as the internet, the telephone, wireless phones, portable laptops, and much more over the last few decades, features such as communication, data transfer, data process, and file management, have become easier. This rise in technology has given hand to businesses to grow. In today's world, people don't have to go shopping for every small thing they want as they can just order online and it will be delivered in their footsteps. This lack of human interaction in business has given flexibility in its growth, expansion, and profits. Online businesses can be conducted with fewer ingredients than physical businesses and can generate more than enough profit if known the quirks of the implemented technology. <br> <br>

In the last two decades, the e-commerce business has grown significantly. Businesses that spent on IT hardware in 2021 accounted for $705.4 billion, data centres accounted for $228.4 billion and semiconductor sales accounted for $469.4 billion. This only proves that now more than ever, technology has affected businesses positively. <br> <br>

Not only businesses but the daily lives of people have become much simpler. With the help of technology, people with physical and mental disabilities have an option for simpler travel with electric chairs, and easy reach for help in case of emergencies. Communication with people from all around the world has become easier, and with everything now online, you can educate yourself from any corner of the world with the help of the internet. <br> <br>

On the other hand, there have been significant disadvantages due to the rise of technology. Digital crimes such as online bullying, hacking, breach of security, privacy concerns, and much more. While online websites have made it easier for people with mental disabilities to interact with others, it has also made others suffer from social isolation and loneliness. People in this generation are used to interacting online that they have forgotten how to interact in person which contributes to social anxiety. Additionally, the increase in Artificial Intelligence has caused job insecurity and job loss. Automated technologies have become a necessary investment in order to reduce the cost of labour. <br> <br>

However, if technology is implemented well can make a huge difference in the growth of a business. If taken selling Bonsai plants online, for example, has more positive than negative impacts. Authentic bonsai plants are difficult to come by in your local grocery store. Therefore, making an online website where people can order bonsai from all over the world can make a huge difference in sales. Buyers will not mind paying extra for website fees or shipping costs, or waiting for a certain period of time for shipping, in order to get the bonsai plant they want. With a safe user-friendly website, it can make all the difference in selling bonsai plants. <br> <br>

Over the past few years, technology has seen colossal growth. Now with the invention of Artificial Technology capable of but not limited to finding stars, developing vaccines, and writing stories, the sky seems to be the limit. But only with safe practice and proper uses of technology, we can advance in it. <br> <br>
